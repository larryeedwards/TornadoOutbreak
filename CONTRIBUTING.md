# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the reverse engineering efforts for Tornado Outbreak. 
By following these guidelines, you can help improve our understanding of the game and contribute to the community's knowledge base. 
Please read these guidelines carefully before making any contributions.
## Rewriting Code
Users are strictly forbidden from rewriting the game's code as it defeats the purpose of reverse engineering. 
The goal of reverse engineering Tornado Outbreak is to understand and analyze the existing code structure and mechanics of the game.

Though, in the future, a potential project aimed at modernizing the game's code could be possible.

### Decompressing Game Files
To extract code from Tornado Outbreak, you will need to decompress the game's files.
There are multiple methods available, but the recommended method isusing the [BGW unpacker](https://github.com/SamuraiOndo/tornado-outbreak-bgw) over other methods such as offzip.
The BGW unpacker not only decompresses the files but also keeps them organized, making it easier for everyone to navigate and analyze the extracted code.
