# Getting Started
### Decompressing Game Files
Extracting code from Tornado Outbreak will require you to decompress the game's .bgw files. There are multiple methods available, but the recommended method isusing the [BGW unpacker](https://github.com/SamuraiOndo/tornado-outbreak-bgw) over other methods such as offzip. The BGW unpacker not only decompresses the files but also keeps them organized, making it easier for everyone to navigate and analyze the extracted code.
