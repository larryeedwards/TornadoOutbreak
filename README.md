# Tornado Outbreak
Open Source code from the 2009 action adventure video game, Tornado Outbreak. 

# Notes
* All code were extracted from the game's .bgw files using SamuraiOndo's bgw unpacker.
* This repository only deals with the Lua aspect of the game!
* A few snippets of source code for the cancelled Nintendo DS port is included, though incomplete. It has no purpose other than for archival and reference purposes only.

# Future plans/wishes
### C++ decompilation 
Tornado Outbreak is primarly written in both Lua and C++. While the Lua is easily readable and extractable, the C++ on the other hand is not, thus required to be decompiled.
### Function documentation
Events.lua covers the gists of the core gameplay functions, but there's alot undocumented ones as well. Documenting these would not only be benificial to modders, but it'll also provide insight on how the game works.
